              <p class="section1-text">
                  To wrap up January, we are proud to bring you the release of Firefox 85. 
                  In this version we are bringing you support for the :focus-visible pseudo-class 
                  in CSS and associated devtools, and the complete removal of Flash support from Firefox.

        <p>The release of Apple Silicon-based Macs at the end of last year generated a flurry of 
          news coverage and some surprises at the machine's performance. This post details some 
          background information on the experience of porting Firefox to run natively on these CPUs.</p>
        <p>We'll start with some background on the Mac transition and give an overview of 
          Firefox internals that needed to know about the new architecture, before moving on to 
          the concept of Universal Binaries.</p>
        <p>We'll then explain how DRM/EME works on the new platform, talk about our experience 
          with macOS Big Sur, and discuss various updater problems we had to deal with. We'll 
          conclude with the release and an overview of various other improvements that are in 
          the pipeline.</p>

            <p>I'd suggest having a popup that asks where in the row to insert the box (at the beginning or end), what title to give the box, what text to put in the box, and where the box should link to. The entire box should serve as a link to the destination page.</p>
